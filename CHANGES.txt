TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs

- Changed the colors to a pallete to my liking (i wanted a pink pallete to match my favorite colors)
- Made all of the little vectors, the little purple puppy (I wanted something to personalize the vectors to something I preferred.)
- Added specific classes in the typography to help adjust coloring (it made better contrast against backgrouds and further emphasized my vision)
- Adjusted Font sizing in the classes (better contrast for heading text)
- Adjust the Navbar so it connects to the existing sections of the page (made for easy navgiation for editing)
- Got rid of the companies sections (jsut didn't seem practical in what I wanted)
- replaced the portfolio images with images I specifically took instead of generating (i just awnted something more personal)
- adjusted hover states colors to contrast better aginst the background
- added icons to the headers for a little pizazz ( i thought it made it look cuter)
- made the waves sharper for a "dramatic" appearance
